# Pangea in Latent Space - Interactive Visualization

An interactive visualization that explores the interconnections between different concepts in a dynamic, elastic boundary space. Built with p5.js, this project creates a fluid, organic interface where concepts float and interact within a bounded space.

## Features

- **Dynamic Elastic Boundary**: A fluid, animated boundary that contains and connects all concepts
- **Interactive Nodes**: Clickable nodes representing different concepts, each linking to relevant resources
- **Collision Detection**: Nodes maintain proper spacing and avoid overlapping
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Motion trails (Toggle with 'V' key)
  - Boundary fill (Toggle with 'F' key)
  - Dynamic text and node visibility
  - Smooth animations and transitions

## Controls

- **[L]** Toggle connection lines
- **[T]** Toggle concept text
- **[B]** Toggle boundary
- **[C]** Toggle circles (nodes)
- **[V]** Toggle motion trails
- **[F]** Toggle boundary fill
- **Slider**: Control animation speed ("TECTONICS")

## Interaction

- Hover over nodes to highlight them
- Click nodes to visit related URLs
- The text "pangea in latent space" follows the boundary and is clickable
- Nodes maintain spacing through collision detection
- Motion creates visual trails when enabled

## Technical Details

- Built with p5.js
- Uses Perlin noise for organic movement
- Implements convex hull algorithm for boundary calculation
- Features elastic animation and color transitions
- Responsive design that adapts to window size

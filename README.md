## Description

This project visualizes interconnected concepts as a living, breathing network. Each node represents a key concept or project, with dynamic connections forming between them as they move through space. The visualization includes:

- Interactive floating nodes with clickable links
- Bilingual support (English/Spanish)
- Dynamic boundary visualization
- Multiple visualization modes
- Fluid animation with adjustable speed
- Responsive design that adapts to window size
